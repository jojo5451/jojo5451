      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>
        At just 15, I discovered a true love and passion for front-end programming, igniting a journey that has shaped my academic and professional pursuits. Through dedication and hard work, I earned a Computer Science concentration and was honored with a Merit Scholarship from CU Boulder, a recognition of both my academic achievements and my creative approach to problem-solving.

        What drives me is the unique intersection of creativity and technology. I thrive in crafting experiences that not only look great but function seamlessly. My specialization lies in data visualization, where I turn raw numbers into compelling stories. Whether it’s exploring complex data sets or designing interactive graphics, I aim to communicate insights in a way that resonates with diverse audiences.
        
        In addition to data visualization, I’ve honed skills in User Experience Design, Programming, and Querying. Each project I undertake is a new opportunity to blend technical expertise with a user-centered approach, ensuring solutions are both innovative and impactful.
